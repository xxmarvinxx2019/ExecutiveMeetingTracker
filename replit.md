# Project Documentation

## Overview

This is a professional inventory management system built with Next.js and TypeScript. The application provides comprehensive inventory tracking, product management, and dashboard analytics for businesses to efficiently manage their stock levels, suppliers, and product categories.

## System Architecture

**Architecture Pattern**: Single Page Application (SPA) with Next.js
- Frontend: Next.js 14 with TypeScript, React components
- Styling: Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui components
- State Management: React hooks and local state
- Data: Mock data simulation (ready for API integration)

**Key Architectural Decisions**:
- Used Next.js App Router for modern React patterns
- Implemented component-based architecture with reusable UI components
- Created comprehensive type definitions for type safety
- Designed modular component structure for scalability

## Key Components

### Frontend Components
- **Dashboard**: Main analytics dashboard with inventory statistics and charts
- **ProductTable**: Comprehensive product listing with search, filter, and CRUD operations
- **UI Components**: Reusable shadcn/ui components (Button, Card, Input, etc.)
- **Navigation**: Sidebar navigation with multiple sections (Dashboard, Products, Suppliers, Reports)

### Data Layer
- **Types**: Comprehensive TypeScript interfaces for Product, StockMovement, Supplier, Category
- **Mock Data**: Realistic sample data for development and demonstration
- **Utilities**: Helper functions for formatting currency, dates, and CSS classes

### Features Implemented
- Product inventory tracking with real-time stock status
- Dashboard with key metrics and analytics
- Advanced search and filtering capabilities
